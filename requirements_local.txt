# GUI Dependencies (choose one or both)
# Gradio - Web-based interface (recommended)
gradio>=4.0.0

# Tkinter - Desktop interface (usually comes with Python, but listed for completeness)
# tkinter is usually included with Python, but if not available:
# Windows: Usually included
# macOS: Usually included
# Linux: sudo apt-get install python3-tk

# Note: For better performance, install PyTorch with CUDA support if you have an NVIDIA GPU:
# pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118

# For CPU-only systems, the above will work but will be slower
